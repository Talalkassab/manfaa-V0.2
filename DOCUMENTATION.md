# Manfaa Business Marketplace Documentation

## Project Overview

Manfaa is a business marketplace platform for Saudi Arabia, providing a space for entrepreneurs to buy and sell businesses. The platform offers a clean, user-friendly interface built with modern web technologies.

## Architecture

The project uses Next.js as its foundation with a hybrid approach:
- Pages Router for main application views
- React components for UI elements
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript for type safety

## Key Components

### Layout
The Layout component (`components/Layout.tsx`) provides a consistent structure for all pages with:
- Navigation bar at the top
- Main content area
- Footer at the bottom

### Navigation
The Navigation component (`components/Navbar.tsx`) includes:
- Manfaa logo
- Main navigation links
- Authentication buttons
- Language selector

### Pages
- **Home Page**: Landing page with featured businesses and marketplace overview
- **Businesses Page**: Lists available businesses for sale/purchase
- **About Page**: Information about Manfaa and its mission
- **Contact Page**: Contact form and company information
- **Sign In/Sign Up Pages**: User authentication interfaces
- **UI Testing Page**: Showcase of all UI components for development

### UI Components
- **Button**: Reusable button component with multiple styles
- **Card**: Container for displaying business information
- **Form Elements**: Input fields, checkboxes, and select inputs
- **Loading Indicator**: Animated loading spinner

## Styling Approach

The project uses Tailwind CSS with:
- Custom color scheme based on teal
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Consistent spacing and typography

## Development Workflow

1. Feature implementation follows the pages structure
2. Components are built in isolation and then integrated
3. Changes are tracked in the CHANGELOG.md
4. Documentation is updated with each major feature addition

## Next Development Phase

The next phase will focus on:
1. Authentication functionality
2. Business listing creation and management
3. Search and filtering capabilities
4. User profiles
5. Business details page with analytics

## Performance Considerations

- Images are optimized for fast loading
- Code splitting is used for improved initial load time
- Server-side rendering where appropriate for SEO benefits
